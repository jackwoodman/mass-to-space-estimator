# massToSpaceCalculator
Calculates the mass to space (Karman line) for some rocket, and some number of spacecraft.

This model determines the maximum mass (in terms of number of spacecraft) that a given rocket can lift above the Karman Line, into space.

(For the purposes of demonstration, the rocket is the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster & the spacecraft is the Crew Dragon_

It assumes the mass to accomodate 7 astronauts is that of a Dragon spacecraft ~ 4,000kg.
The output is a series of plots, showing Mass, Velocity and Altitude over time for each mass that can reach space,
with the final plot displaying the best solution. Following this plot is an output displaying the mass and
equivalent number of Dragon capsules, and therefore number of astronauts that could visit space for said mass.
